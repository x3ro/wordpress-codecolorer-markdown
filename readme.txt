Enables CodeColorer for any code block created by the markdown-for-wordpress-and-bbpress
plugin.


== Description ==

This plugin automatically wraps Markdown code blocks (indented by 4 spaces or a tab)
in CodeColorer tags. You can also specify what language the given snippet uses, by using
the following syntax:

        :ruby:
        class Foo < Bar
        end

That is, the name of the language, as you'd use it when creating a CodeColorer block,
enclosed by two colons on the very first line of the code snippet.

The source code repository can be found over at
[GitHub](http://github.com/x3ro/wordpress-codecolorer-markdown).
